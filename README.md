# Overview

This is an on-going project to analyze the scriptures.  As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints I spend a lot of time studying the scriptures such as the Bible and Book of Mormon.  I decided to combine that with my love of coding to see what insights I could find.  

# Web Scrape
---
My first step was to store the text in a format I can analyze.  There may be places to find these in a downloadable format but that would be easy.  I have never web scraped before so I figured now would be as good a time as any to learn.  I used the beautiful soup library with Python to comb through churchofjesuschrist.org to store text in a csv file.

The initial text pull is successful, currently I am working on iterating through each chapter so everything can be pulled at once.
